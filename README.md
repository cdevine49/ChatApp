# Chatter

Chatter is a mobile chat app. Current functionality includes the ability to sign up, sign in, and sign out, update account information, send and receive messages to one or more individuals and search for fellow users.

Soon, users will be able to add fellow users to contacts and give names to conversations so they can be found easily.

## Technical

Chatter uses Firebase's realtime database so messages are received immediately.  The front-end uses react-native so it will work on both ios and android.
